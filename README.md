# About This Fork

GPT Next Web has been an incredible project, offering a robust platform for exploring Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) capabilities. In this fork, we've added key features to extend its functionality:

## Authentication:

To ensure a secure and personalized experience, we've integrated an authentication system. This allows users to create accounts, manage their sessions, and ensure their interactions are private and secure.

## Credit System:

We've implemented a credit system to manage usage. This feature is particularly useful for rationing API calls or other resources, ensuring fair usage among all users.

## start
